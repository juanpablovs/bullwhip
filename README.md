# A little script that helps deal with the bullwhip effect challenge for data scientists

Hello,

I once got an engagement from a customer where I had to create a new product using information from the queries that existing customers were making to the companyâ€™s API.

This is a somewhat sophisticated project where you have to fetch and classify millions of customer queries and find economic value in them.

My customer wanted to add this product to its portfolio and it had to sell well for them.

I used GraphQL to make the queries.

The project was ultimately quite successful, and the company actually made the news for it.

The new product is related to minimizing the bullwhip effect for companies.

Here is some information about the bullwhip effect:

As you can see, for any given company, reducing inventory inefficiencies has a direct impact on profitability. Hence the success of the project.

After the right amount of time has passed by, I am ready to share the script hoping that it helps someone that has the same problem.

I hope that it helps you and makes your life a little easier!

Thanks!
